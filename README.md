## Hi there!
My name is Jejebecarte, or Jeje for short. My favourite colour is purple, and I'm from Australia!
- I'm interested in all things programming, and work across a variety of different topics.
- I have experience with JS/TS, Java, C#, Python, C++ and more! (I swear, the most used languages stat is lying!)
- Any and all feedback on my work is much appreciated, so if you'd like to provide me with some, click [here](https://github.com/Jejebecarte/Jejebecarte/issues) to contact me.
